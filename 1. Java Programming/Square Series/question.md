# Square Increment Sequence Generator - Java Control Structures

## Objective
To work with control structures in Java by generating a number sequence using loops.

## Concept Explanation
Control structures like `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops enable repetition in a program. These are essential for performing repeated tasks, such as generating a series based on a pattern or condition.

In this case:
- A `for` loop is used to iterate exactly 10 times.
- During each iteration, the square of a consecutive number starting from the input is calculated, 1 is added, and the result is printed.

## Scenario
Anand, a math enthusiast, is fascinated by number series. He designs a pattern where each term is generated by squaring a number and adding 1 to it. As a Java developer, your task is to help him by implementing a program that generates the first 10 numbers of this **Square Increment Sequence**.

## Sequence Logic
Given a starting number `n`, the series is calculated as:
```
(n^2 + 1), ((n+1)^2 + 1), ((n+2)^2 + 1), ..., ((n+10)^2 + 1)
```

## Constraints
- Display only the first 10 numbers of the series.
- Do not use `System.exit(0)` to terminate the program.
- Follow Java's object-oriented conventions and the code structure if provided.

## Sample Input and Output

### Example
**Input:**
```
Enter the first number  
5  
```

**Output:**
```
Required Square Increment Sequence  
26 37 50 65 82 101 122 145 170 197 226
```

**Explanation:**
```
26 = 5^2 + 1  
37 = 6^2 + 1  
50 = 7^2 + 1  
65 = 8^2 + 1  
82 = 9^2 + 1  
101 = 10^2 + 1  
122 = 11^2 + 1  
145 = 12^2 + 1  
170 = 13^2 + 1  
197 = 14^2 + 1  
226 = 15^2 + 1
```

## Notes
- Ensure proper class, method, and attribute naming.
- Follow object-oriented design principles as per instructions.
