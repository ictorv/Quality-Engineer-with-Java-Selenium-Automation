# 1. Modify Employee.java to resolve the conflict
# (This step is manual â€” you edit the file to look like this:)
# public class Employee {
#     int empid;
#     String name;
# }

# 2. Add Employee.java to Git
git add Employee.java

# 3. Commit the resolved file
git commit -m "Employee is in sync with branch"

# 4. Merge DEV_feature with master (already done, but this ensures it's complete)
git merge DEV_feature
